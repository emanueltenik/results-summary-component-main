        You scored higher than 65% of the
        people who have taken these tests.
    </p>

}

### Continued development

I appreciate having tried out this project challenge, because it has given me a chance to apply my newly learnt skills in basic HTML and CSS. 

Am looking forward to doing more practice by taking more challenges to expand my knowledge and  learning other web technologies.
